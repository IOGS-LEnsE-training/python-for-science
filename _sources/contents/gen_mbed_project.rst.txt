.. _mbed_blinky:

Compile and test
****************

MBED-OS primarily uses **C++** as the programming language for developing applications and firmware. 

.. note::
	
	If you are not familiar with the **C++ language**, tutorials are available at the following address: `C++ - Basics and Object-Oriented Programming  <https://iogs-lense-training.github.io/cpp-basics-oop/>`_.

.. note::

	Most of the following steps are the same in *Keil Studio Cloud* and *MBED Studio*. Otherwise, a note will specify the differences.

Main file
=========

On the left side of the interface, click on your project (here :menuselection:`01_First_Project` to display its contents.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_main.png
	:align: center
	
	First project contents.
	
Projects basically contain about ten files and directories. They are useful at various stages of the project realization.

But the **most essential** is the :file:`main.cpp` file. It contains the :code:`main()` function that serves as the entry point of the program. 

Click :menuselection:`main.cpp` file to open it on the top-right side of the interface.

*We will see later its content.*

Select a target
===============

Although the MBED-OS operating system is designed for a wide range of microcontrollers from the STM32 family, it is necessary to **specify** to the compiler for which **target** the program is being developed.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_target_select.png
	:align: center
	:width: 60%
	
	Target selection.

.. note::

	At LEnsE, we mainly use Nucleo-L476RG and Nucleo-G431KB boards.

If you don't select a target, the **compilation button is not enabled**. When you select a target, some options of the compilation process are automatically set up.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_target_no.png
	:align: center
	:width: 60%
	
	No compilation options if no target is selected.

Compile
=======

The C++ program is not understandable by the microcontroller. A **compilation step** is necessary to translate your code to native language of the microcontroller: a list of basic instructions.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_compile.png
	:align: center
	:width: 30%
	
	Compilation button (in blue).

Click on the **build button** (the blue one with a *hammer*) to compile your code. In the bottom-right side of the interface, the list of the files being compiled is display.

.. note::

	In the MBED Studio version, you can choose the *Build profile*. In *Debug* mode, you have access to inline debugging tools but it tooks more spaces in the memory contrary to the *Release* mode. 

After a few moment, and if no error occured during the compilation process, you obtain the same type of informations as displayed in the next figure:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_compile_output.png
	:align: center
	:width: 70%
	
	End of successful compilation process.

Depending on the development environment you used, you have two options.

Keil Studio Cloud
-----------------

A **binary file** is generated and downloaded on your computer (depending on your browser options).

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_compile_bin_file.png
	:align: center
	:width: 40%

	Binary file to download.

MBED Studio
-----------

A binary file is created in a sub-directory of your project directory. Depending on the target you specified, the binary file is stored in the :file:`project_dir\\BUILD\\NUCLEO_target\\ARM6\\` directory, where *target* is the name of the target (for example: G431KB) and *project\_dir* the name of the directory where you stored your project.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_compile_file_dir.png
	:align: center
	:width: 80%

|

Flash the program
=================

The final step, before enjoying to play with your new system, is to **flash the binary file into the microcontroller**. *STMicroelectronics*, through the design of their Nucleo boards, facilitates the code uploading step into the microcontroller.

.. note::

	Make sure that your board is connected to your computer via a USB cable.

The Nucleo boards are recognized on computers as **USB storage devices**. But you can only store binary files as the previously generated by MBED compiler.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/nucleo/nucleo_usb_device.png
	:align: center
	:width: 40%

	G431KB Nucleo boards recognized as a USB storage device.


You just have to **copy and paste** the binary file (bin extension) from your computer to the Nucleo device. After few seconds, the Nucleo device flashes the internal memory of the onboard-microcontroller.

During the transfer of the file, the **LD1** (or **COM**) led is blinking in red and green. At the end of the transfer, this led stops blinking.

Duplicate a project
*******************

.. note::
	
	It is recommended to **create a new project** each time you develop a new application.
	
Instead of entirely creating a new project each time, you can also **duplicate an existing project**.

Right-click on the project you want to duplicate and click :menuselection:`Duplicate` .

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_duplicate.png
	:align: center
	:width: 70%

|

A second project with the same name following by the term *copy* is generated. 

.. figure:: ../_static/images/keil/keil_duplicate_project.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 60%

|

You can **change its name** by right-click on the new project and then click :menuselection:`Rename` . 

You can also **set this new project as the active one** by right-click on the project and then click :menuselection:`Set Active Project` . 

Pre-compiler informations
*************************

A specific file, called :file:`mbed_app.json` , allows developers to specify configuration options and parameters for their Mbed applications.

This JSON file is typically used to configure various aspects of the application, such as: target configuration, feature configuration, peripheral configuration or library configuration.

Baremetal option
================

**Baremetal** refers to programming directly on hardware without the use of an operating system. In baremetal programming, developers have direct control over the hardware resources and can write code that interacts directly with the hardware peripherals and registers. 

.. code-block::

	{
		"requires": [ "bare-metal"],
		"target_overrides": {
		  "*": {
			"target.printf_lib": "minimal-printf",
			"platform.minimal-printf-enable-floating-point": true,
			"platform.stdio-baud-rate": 115200
		  }
		}
	}
	
In this example, the **baremetal** modules are required.

The other options, specified in the target_overrides part, allow the use of the :code:`printf()` function (linked to the virtual serial port of the USB connection) and set the baudrate of the transmission to 115200 bauds.

SD card, FAT filesystem options
===============================

If you want to use a **SD card** and a **FAT filesystem**, other options are required. For example:

.. code-block::

	{
		"requires": [ "bare-metal", "rtos-api", "sd","filesystem","fat_chan"],
		"target_overrides": {
		  "*": {
			"target.components_add": [ "SD" ]
		  }
		}
	}
	
	
CMSIS-DSP library
=================

.. code-block::

	{
		"requires": ["bare-metal","cmsis-dsp"]
	}
